           <br> I believe my reason for taking a class in Programming is because i didn't
            have the necessary skills to build My Career after finishing my University Education.
            It is also clear to me that learning and doing things practical are two diffrent things
            since in University they don't really teach the technical part of Programming.
           </br>
           So being able to specialize  in Programming will enable me to advance as a Developer an be able to
           work on my own as Self-employed and get a better understanding  of the Programming world.
